# Steadborn Dev Blog

#### What's This About?

This Dev Blog Servs as a weekly progress update on whats going on with our Voxel Game. We are a small studio so updates can often be super small and sometimes even feel like they are going backwards at times. This Dev Blog solves this problem by showing the weekly progress and ever changing goals we are acomplishing with our passion project Steadborn!

#### What to expect?

We plan on showcasing even the technical side of our project. We are currently heavy in development within voxel world building. This is no easy task. It also will make up 100 percent of the world in Steadborn. So to show we are working on the game we will update this blog weekly with technical information + gameplay design choices and the reason behind them!

## [0.0.1] – Dev Blog Creation! <span class="tag">07/27/2025</span>

Welcome to the first official dev blog for Steadborn – our voxel-based survival and colony-building game. This marks the beginning of regular behind-the-scenes updates, where we’ll show off technical breakthroughs, design decisions, and even the messy parts of game development.

We’re deep into the guts of terrain generation right now – building a world system from scratch is no joke. But this blog is here to prove we’re making steady (and sometimes chaotic) progress.

Stay tuned. Weekly updates start now.
