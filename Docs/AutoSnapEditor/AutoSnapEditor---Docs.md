# AutoSnap – Editor Plugin

**AutoSnap – Editor** is a lightweight Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enhances your level design workflow with hotkey-based snapping controls. It allows precise modular asset placement while dragging actors in the editor — without touching Unreal’s built-in grid snapping.

## Features

- Snap actors automatically.
- ⌨ Hotkey toggles for X, Y, Z axis snapping
- Snap distance control via Shift + Mouse Wheel
- Optional grid overlay (visual feedback)
- Toggle debug logs for tracking snap state
- Minimal, efficient C++/Blueprint-friendly setup

## Installation

If you installed this from the **Fab Marketplace**, Unreal will automatically place the plugin into your project's `Plugins` folder.

### 1. Enable the Plugin

Go to:

> You can also toggle it from the main menu:

### 2. Restart the Editor

You must restart the Unreal Editor for the plugin to activate.

## How It Works

- Enable AutoSnap via `Shift + G` and Disable Unreal Engine's Legacy Snapping Logic in editor.
- The plugin does **not** override or depend on native UE snapping.
- It uses your defined snap size and axis settings.
- Snap size can be dynamically increased or decreased.
- You can enable/disable snapping on individual axes (X, Y, Z).
- A visual grid or log feedback system is available.

## Editor Hotkeys

| Action                   | Hotkey                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Toggle snapping globally | `Shift + G`                |
| Increase snap size       | `Shift + Mouse Wheel Up`   |
| Decrease snap size       | `Shift + Mouse Wheel Down` |
| Toggle X axis snapping   | `Shift + X`                |
| Toggle Y axis snapping   | `Shift + Y`                |
| Toggle Z axis snapping   | `Shift + Z`                |
| Toggle debug logs        | `Shift + D`                |

## Configuration Panel

In the settings panel, you can configure:

- Snap Distance & Step Size
- Axis toggles
- Debug log options
- Grid visibility
- Hotkey bindings

> Note: All hotkeys are combined with `Shift` (e.g., `Shift + X`, `Shift + D`, etc.)

## Disable Native UE Grid Snapping

When using **AutoSnap**, you should disable Unreal Engine’s **built-in grid snapping** to avoid conflicts.

AutoSnap provides its own snapping system, and leaving this toggle on may lead to inconsistent movement or double-snapping behavior.

To disable native snapping:

1. Locate the **Snapping Toolbar** in the top editor bar.
2. **Uncheck the grid snapping icon** (see below):
