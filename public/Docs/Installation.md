## Step 1: Open the Epic Games Launcher

After purchasing a Ghillie Studios product:

1. Launch the **Epic Games Launcher**.
2. In the top navigation bar, click on **Library**.

## Step 2: Locate the Fab Product

Scroll down to the bottom of the Library tab to find the **Fab Library** section.  
Use the search bar to locate your purchased plugin or asset.

## Step 3: Install to Engine or Project

Depending on the product type, you’ll see one of two options:

- **Install to Engine** –  
  This installs the plugin for _all_ projects using the selected engine version. Choose your desired version and click **Install**.

- **Add to Project** –  
  If prompted, select the specific project you want to add the content to and click **Add**.

## Step 4: Enable the Plugin (if applicable)

If the product is a plugin:

1. Open your Unreal Engine project (must match the engine version you installed the plugin to).
2. Go to `Edit > Plugins`.
3. Search for the plugin by name (e.g., “RTSCamPro” or “AutoSnap – Runtime”).
4. Enable it by checking the box.
5. Restart the editor when prompted.

## File Location

Once installed, plugin files will be located at:

`[EngineInstallDirectory]/Engine/Plugins/[PluginName]/`
